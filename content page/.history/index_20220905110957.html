                         Some electronics and appliances in your home consume more energy than others. In 2021, there was a 20% increase in the account electricity, and an additional fee of R$ 14 started to be charged every 100 kWh (kilowatt-hour, measure of energy) consumed. For save on expenses, understand how the devices you uses work can make a difference in the price of the bill at the end of the month.

                         Appliances that convert electrical energy into heat, such as refrigerators and showers, are the ones that most impact the electricity bill. Nonetheless, without conscious use, even items such as computers and video games can weigh in at the end of the month. See below what are the
                         electronics and appliances that consume the most energy in your house. We also spoke with the coordinator of the energy and sustainability of the Brazilian Institute for the Defense of Consumer (Idec), Clauber Leite, who gave tips that will help you to save money.

                    <h2>1. Refrigerator</h2>
                    <p>Essential in our lives, the refrigerator helps to maintain food and beverages in a good state of conservation. To do so, she withdraws her internal heat, transferring it to the region outside it. This process 
                    transformation is quite costly because it involves the transformation of electric power in heat, which consumes a lot of light.</p>
                    <p>An ordinary refrigerator, without being frost-free, consumes on average 93 kWh per month - or, according to Enel's calculator, about $80 in the electricity bill.Depending on her power and her other characteristics (such as your engine type), it is possible that this value is higher or lower.In addition to its specificities, there are also other factors that can impact this level of consumption.</p>
                    <p>How refrigerators work to maintain their indoor environment lower temperatures, when we open their doors we change their internal balance. This is because of direct heat exchange with the outside. According to the coordinator of the energy and sustainability of the Brazilian Institute of Consumer Protection (Idec), Clauber Leite, when in excess, this action may weigh on the light bill. "If you open and close [the refrigerator] often, changing these internal temperature factors, the refrigerator engine will trigger more often and consequently will consume more energy," said.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, according to Clauber, the ideal is to maintain a relationship conscious with the refrigerator, opening it only when necessary. Thus, for those who want economics, that classic story of spend several minutes with the door open, just staring inside appliance, should also be left out of the</p>

                         the appliance will never really close -- what, 
                         consequently, it will cause even greater light consumption. This 
                         so, it is important to pay attention to the state in which the parts are
